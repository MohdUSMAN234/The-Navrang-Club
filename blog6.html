      <h1>Exploring Creativity: My Role at Navrang</h1>
      <p>Welcome to Navrang, where creativity blooms and culture shines! As the promotional head at PSIT's 
      Navrang club, my journey has been full of growth, learning, and amazing experiences. Let me share with 
      you what I've learned and how Navrang has shaped me.</p>
      <h2>Responsibilities: What I Do</h2>
      <p></p>My job as promotional head is to spread the word about Navrang's events and activities. I create 
      posters, plan social media posts, and come up with ideas to get students excited about what we're 
      doing. It's not just about advertising; it's about making sure everyone feels included and eager to join in.
      <h2>Learning: What I've Gained</h2>
      <p>Being in this role has taught me a lot. One big lesson is how important it is to communicate clearly. 
      Whether I'm talking to sponsors, working with my team, or explaining our plans to teachers, being clear 
      and professional is key to getting things done right.
      I've also gotten better at organizing my time. Balancing different tasks and handling unexpected 
      problems has made me more organized and better at adapting to changes. These are skills I'll use in 
      whatever I do in the future.</p>
      <h2>Creativity: What I've Created</h2>
      <p>Navrang has been a place for me to explore my creative side. I've come up with themes for events and 
      designed posters that catch people's attention. Working with others in the club has helped me learn 
      new ways to think creatively and make our ideas come to life.</p>
      <h2>Looking Forward: What Comes Next</h2>
      <p>Being part of Navrang has been amazing for me. It's helped me grow as a leader and as someone who 
        can share ideas effectively. I'm excited to keep contributing to Navrang and to help others see how fun 
        and important cultural activities can be.
        In Navrang, every color tells a story, and creativity is celebrated. My role as promotional head has been 
        a rewarding experience that's taught me a lot. I'm thankful for all I've learned and can't wait to see 
        what's next for me and for Navrang.</p>
        <h3>Join Navrang. Explore Creativity. Celebrate Culture.</h3>
