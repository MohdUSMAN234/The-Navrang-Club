      <h1>Importance of Cutural Activities in 
        Technical Studies</h1>
        <p>Previously, collegelife used to be lectures 
        and attendance. Now, student's 
        engagement and their preparation towards 
        the real world depends on the cultural fest 
        and events. It encourages them to 
        participate and showcase their talent. The 
        advanced cultural events, technical fests, 
        performance and competitions with friends 
        make an engineering student confident 
        and job-ready. College fests play an 
        important role in shaping the career of a 
        student. Companies prefer hiring 
        candidates of the best Engineering 
        Colleges who are knowledgeable, expert in 
        their field. have good communication skills 
        and are interactive with clients. If a 
        candidate has been an active participant in 
        college fest, cultural activities, sports 
        tournaments or anything outside the 
        classroom then it shows their latent ad 
        ability. If students who wish to pursue 
        higher studies, these co-curricular activities 
        make them different from others. </p>
        <p>Involvement in college fest along with 
        studies teaches students to manage time 
        efficienty, prioritize work, follow schedule, 
        and honor deadlines. 
        Fest and events at Engineering College 
        provide many opportunities to interact 
        with your peers and form new 
        connections. While organizing any fest, 
        students stumble upon new people and 
        build their strong networks. Most of these 
        activities are GD by which students get to 
        know about people from different cutural 
        backgrounds and interests. These healthy 
        interactions not only enhance the 
        interpersonal communication skills but also 
        prepares them for the real world. Technical 
        fest provides a platform for young brains to 
        showcase their innovative ideas and 
        compete with their peers. </p>
        <p>Those who can multi-task, take initiative, 
        and are enterprising have better chances 
        of getting hired. students grow in multiple 
        directions if they actively participate in 
        college fest. Students who volunteer and 
        organize college fest display their 
        self-started attitude, which is highly 
        appreciated by recruiters, specially while 
        hiring for administrative positions.</p>
