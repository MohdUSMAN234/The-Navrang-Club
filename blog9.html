        <p>Culture is the collective expression of human life, reflecting the way people live, think, and interact with each other and their environment.</p>
        <p>Everyone has a unique relationship with the culture, and we, as the members of the Navrang Club at PSIT, Kanpur, are no exception. Our relationship with the culture, as well as our team members, is evident in our work. Our club provides a platform that celebrates the diverse talents of its members, giving everyone a chance to recognize their true selves and what they truly enjoy doing.</p>

        <h2>Relationship with Self</h2>
        <p>Engaging in cultural activities like music, dance, art, and more builds the overall well-being of a person and leads to profound self-discovery and personal growth. Even in times of difficulties, we learn how to cope, offering a sense of stability and continuity that enriches our personal lives.</p>

        <h2>Relationship with Members</h2>
        <p>The club activities offer a variety of experiences and knowledge in different fields, shaping our future. It builds a supportive network where we can ask endless questions related to both the club and college. Our seniors encourage this curiosity, sharing their lessons and helping us avoid the mistakes they made. This mentorship is invaluable for our personal and professional development.</p>

        <h2>My Personal Journey</h2>
        <p>Joining the Navrang Club was my first wish when I joined the college. I remember searching for the college’s cultural club late at night when we got access to the ERP portal. My interest in dancing is a hobby that I never abandoned, or rather, it never abandoned me. I participated in every school dance event, even when I sometimes made mistakes. Once, I froze on stage, and the whole audience laughed. I thought that was the end of my relationship with dancing, but it wasn’t. I continued to perform and learned from my mistakes.</p>
        <p>Before coming to college, I worried that entering a tech field would mean that music or dance wouldn't be relevant, and I wouldn't be able to participate in any events. However, that thought couldn’t stop me. I took part in Ignitia’s "Show Your Talent" event. I had mixed emotions and thoughts of running away, but nothing could stop me. After that, I started my own Instagram page where I post dance videos. Now I know that I want to pursue it with all my heart. My passion for dance is a big part of who I am, and I learn a lot from it. Whenever there is no dance in my life, I feel an emptiness that can only be filled by it.</p>
        <p>I hope I’ll get the amazing chance to join the Navrang Club and continue nurturing my relationship with the culture.</p>
