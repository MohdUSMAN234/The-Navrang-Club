           <p> It has been my honor to host the vibrant, special, and enthusiastic cultural events of The Navrang Club,
            PSIT – “Show Your Talent” and “The Navrang Beats” in IGNITIA 2k24. I recall my journey as a
            complete fresher in PSIT – full of dreams and energy, eager to explore different aspects of college life,
            develop strong networks, and hone my interpersonal skills alongside my academic studies. With a passion
            for music, I used to play guitar in my leisure time. Then, I was introduced to the amazing cultural club of
            our college – The Navrang Club. I was completely mesmerized and driven towards the events the club
            had planned at the time and was keen to be a part of them.</p>


            <p>Vaibhavi Didi (Our Ex-President &#129505) was leading the Club at that time. I was truly inspired by the way
            she managed and planned out various and energetic events for all of us, making sure there were no
            inconveniences. She truly motivated me. I approached her, asking to be part of the club. She suggested I
            serve as a Club Volunteer and explained the process of joining something extraordinary.
            That day, a complete fresher, and today, I stand before you all as the President of The Navrang Club,
            PSIT – it has been quite a journey so far and a complete honor to me. It has been a roller-coaster ride.
            There were the initial days, when being part of and managing events seemed difficult, and also the days
            where post-event, we used to dance together to our favorite beats! Vaibhavi Didi has been a complete
            source of motivation for me! (Thank you so much Didi for being you! &#x2728)</p>


           <p> Mukesh Sir (The Navrang Club PSIT's Club Ambassador) was our primary source of guidance, advice,
            and support whenever we needed it. Without his vision for the club, it all looked impractical. Muskan, the
            Vice President of the club, was also a big support in my journey, helping me make the dream come true!
            My team - Akriti (Club Secretary), Ojasvee (Singing Head), Nishant (Social Media Head), Shashank
            (Treasurer), Rachit (Promotional Head), Rishi (Graphics Head), Vijay (Creative Head), and Usman
            (Technical Head) - was my biggest strength throughout my journey. The Navrang Club will always hold a
            special place in my heart!</p>


            <p>This year, our annual techno-cultural fest ‘IGNITIA 2k24’ had the theme “Adhvanik,” presenting the
            memories, the moments of joy we shared going down memory lane, and the spark for the future! The
            Navrang Club, PSIT, along with our partner The Navrang Club, PSIT-CHE, decided to plan two events to
            engage the crowd and ensured an amazing time in IGNITIA! “Show Your Talent” provided a platform for
            students to showcase their incredible talents and rule the stage! “The Navrang Beats” offered a platform
            to present a theme-based performance and win the cheer of the audience. We are grateful for the energetic
            response from the PSITians, which made the events successful.</p>

           <p> Previously, collegelife used to be lectures and attendance. Now, student's engagement and their preparation towards the real world depends on the cultural fest and events. It encourages them to participate and showcase their talent. The advanced cultural events, technical fests, performance and competitions with friends make an engineering student confident and job-ready. College fests play an important role in shaping the career of a student. Companies prefer hiring candidates of the best Engineering Colleges who are knowledgeable, expert in their field. have good communication skills and are interactive with clients. If a candidate has been an active participant in college fest, cultural activities, sports tournaments or anything outside the classroom then it shows their latent ad ability. If students who wish to pursue higher studies, these co-curricular activities make them different from others.

Involvement in college fest along with studies teaches students to manage time efficienty, prioritize work, follow schedule, and honor deadlines. Fest and events at Engineering College provide many opportunities to interact with your peers and form new connections. While organizing any fest, students stumble upon new people and build their strong networks. Most of these activities are GD by which students get to know about people from different cutural backgrounds and interests. These healthy interactions not only enhance the interpersonal communication skills but also prepares them for the real world. Technical fest provides a platform for young brains to showcase their innovative ideas and compete with their peers.

Those who can multi-task, take initiative, and are enterprising have better chances of getting hired. students grow in multiple directions if they actively participate in college fest. Students who volunteer and organize college fest display their self-started attitude, which is highly appreciated by recruiters, specially while hiring for administrative positions.</p>
