            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Since its inception in 2004, Pranveer Singh Institute of Technology (PSIT), Kanpur has been a frontrunner
                in the field of education with numerous achievements to its name. PSIT believes in strengthening the
                foundation of the students. Academic research based on rigorous pedagogy equips our students to face
                challenges in the real world. The institute prepares students to be ethical leaders in a diverse and
                complex world. PSIT offers various courses in Engineering, Business Management and Computer
                Applications. All departments, with their dynamic community of students and distinguished faculty, offer
                premium undergraduate and postgraduate programs. State of the art facilities and a sprawling 80 acres
                campus nestled amid sylvan surroundings accelerate the learning process.</p>

                <p>The PSIT campus is an architectural marvel. Designed as the best environment-friendly campus in North
                India, we are committed to providing our students a clean and healthy environment. A 25,000 Ltr RO
                Plant, a 1350 KW Power Plant and a three-chambered Vermicompost Plant reaffirm our commitment to the
                cause.</p>

                <p> Our infrastructure, which includes an auditorium, modern workshops, high-tech labs, spacious seminar
                halls and well stocked libraries, can compete with the best campuses. Internet access at 1.5 Gbps (STM
                -1) with 500 Mbps backup line, a 24Ã—7 Power Backup enabled through 33KV Power Line fuel our thirst for
                knowledge. Our fleet of 38 air-conditioned CNG buses ensures an efficient transportation network.</p>

                <p> The institute provides a stimulating environment for intellectual development, free-thinking, and
                personal growth. The academic setup challenges its students with dynamic learning opportunities. We
                equip them with the skills, insights, attitudes, and practical experiences to take up responsibilities
                in their careers and life.</p>

                <p> PSIT owes its commitment to excellence to its illustrious faculty. A stringent selection process of
                faculty members is the cornerstone of our success. The exceptionally talented and seasoned teaching
                fraternity motivates the students to push boundaries and become the best versions of themselves.</p>

                <p> The annual placement portfolio of PSIT is a testimony to its excellent track record of outstanding
                placements through which our students are ready to carve a niche for themselves in the professional
                world.</p>

                <p> PSIT prepares its students to establish themselves in their chosen field of academics with an aim to
                develop well-rounded and discerning citizens.</p>
